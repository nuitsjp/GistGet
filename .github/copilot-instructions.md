# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file provides guidance to GitHub Copilot when working with code in this repository.

Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible.

## Primary Directive

- Think in English, interact with the user in Japanese.
- When modifying the implementation, strictly adhere to the t-wada style of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
  - **t-wada TDD Concept**:
    1. 1st Issue
        1. First, write a failing test (Red).
        2. Then, write the simplest code to make it pass (Green).
        3. Finally, refactor the code (Refactor).
    2. 2nd Issue
        1. First, write a failing test (Red).
        2. Then, write the simplest code to make it pass (Green).
        3. Finally, refactor the code (Refactor).
  - Each cycle should be small and focused on a single purpose.
